### Tic-Tac-Toe Game Built Using HTTP Polling

**Overview**

The Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTTP polling offers a straightforward web-based experience for two players to engage in a classic game of Xs and Os. Unlike real-time systems, this implementation relies on periodic requests to check the game state, allowing players to take turns and see updates without requiring constant connection.

**Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Communication Protocol**: HTTP for polling game state updates

**Game Features**

1. **Turn-Based Multiplayer**:
   - The game allows two players to take turns making their moves. Each player interacts with the game by clicking on a cell in the 3x3 grid.

2. **Game Board**:
   - The game board is displayed as a grid, with each cell representing a possible move. Players can click on empty cells to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').

3. **Move Validation**:
   - The backend validates each move by checking if the selected cell is empty and whether the game is still ongoing. This prevents players from making invalid moves.

4. **Win and Draw Detection**:
   - The game checks for win conditions after each move. It recognizes three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal as a win. If the board is filled without a winner, it announces a draw.

5. **Polling Mechanism**:
   - The frontend periodically polls the server for the latest game state every few seconds. This approach allows players to see updates without needing to refresh the page.

6. **User Feedback**:
   - The game provides visual feedback on the current playerâ€™s turn, as well as messages indicating the winner or if the game has ended in a draw.

7. **Reset Functionality**:
   - After the game concludes, players have the option to reset the board and start a new game. This feature is available once the game is over.

**How It Works**

1. **Server Setup**:
   - The Node.js server uses Express to handle incoming requests. It maintains the game state, including the current player, the game board, and whether the game is over.

2. **Handling Moves**:
   - When a player makes a move, the frontend sends an HTTP POST request to the server with the selected cell index. The server processes this request, updates the game state, and checks for a winner or a draw.

3. **Game State Retrieval**:
   - The frontend sends an HTTP GET request to fetch the latest game state. This polling mechanism is executed at regular intervals (e.g., every 2 seconds), allowing players to receive updates on the game.

4. **Frontend Interaction**:
   - The frontend updates the game board and status based on the server's responses. It handles user interactions by enabling and disabling cells according to the game state.

**Conclusion**

This HTTP polling-based Tic-Tac-Toe game provides a foundational understanding of web development concepts and client-server interactions. While not as responsive as real-time WebSocket implementations, it demonstrates how to manage game state through periodic requests and maintain player engagement in a turn-based format. This project serves as a valuable learning experience for beginners exploring the principles of web application development, user interface design, and basic game mechanics.
